        We've been developing ShareX for the past 9 years. It always has been, and will continue to be, free and open source software. ShareX isn't just free in terms of price; there are no advertisements. Just like our users, we don't like ads. Donations are our only source of income and allow us to keep ShareX free. If you would like to support our project then please consider donating.

            Unfortunately <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/paypal-to-halt-operations-in-turkey-after-losing-license-impacts-hundreds-of-thousands/">PayPal stopped its service in my country on 2016-06-06</a> and I'm unable to receive donations through PayPal anymore.
            <br />We opened Patreon campaign if you would like to support our project. It allows donations both through PayPal and credit card therefore it is the best alternative we have.
