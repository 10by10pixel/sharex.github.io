### What is AppVeyor?

Each time we upload code changes to [GitHub](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX), the [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com) service automatically downloads the latest code changes from GitHub, compiles ShareX and creates setup/portable dev builds.

### Automatic way to install dev build

* Open ShareX application settings window.

* **Mouse middle click** (not left click) on pre-release checkbox to start auto update process:
