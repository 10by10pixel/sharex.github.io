1. Open "Application settings" window either from main window or tray menu.

2. Click "Install dev build" button to start auto update progress.

    If it gave error, most likely that could mean we uploaded new code changes and setup is not compiled with latest changes yet or latest code base is failing to compile. So you can wait few minutes and try clicking install button again.
