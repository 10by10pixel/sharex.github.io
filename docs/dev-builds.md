## How to try dev builds?

### What is AppVeyor?

Each time we upload (commit) code changes to [GitHub](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX), the [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com) service automatically downloads the latest code changes from GitHub, compiles ShareX and creates setup/portable builds.

### How to find latest download links

Open our AppVeyor project page:

[https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ShareX/sharex](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ShareX/sharex)

Open release build page:
