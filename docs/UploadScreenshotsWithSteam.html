<h2>Upload screenshots with Steam Overlay UI</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Note:</strong> You can use the ShareX &quot;watch folder&quot; feature with the Steam overlay UI to upload screenshots automatically. Below is an instruction for it.</div>

<p>If you're using Steam, you can take a screenshot from a game and upload it automatically using ShareX and the Steam overlay UI. </p>

<p>1. Open Steam settings menu and switch to the &quot;in-game&quot; tab.</p>

<p>Check &quot;Save an uncompressed copy&quot; and choose a folder to store screenshots by clicking &quot;Screenshot folder&quot; button.</p>

<p>2. You will probably want to convert the image formats automatically because Steam will save your screenshots uncompressed and those files can be pretty big. The image below shows how you can use ShareX to convert them to a .jpg or .png type in the settings menu.</p>

<p>3. Use the ShareX settings again to create a &quot;watch folder&quot; like this:</p>

<p>The &quot;watch folder&quot; will automatically upload new images from the folder you selected as they are added. The watch folder path should point to your directory of uncompressed Steam screenshots.</p>

<p>4. You can now open your Steam game and press your Steam screenshot key (set to F12 by default) at any time to export a screenshot.</p>

<p>ShareX will notice the new file appear in the folder you specified and upload it automatically. If you completed step 2 then ShareX will compress image before uploading.</p>
