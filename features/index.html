        <p>ShareX (formerly known as ZScreen) is a free and open-source screenshooting and screencasting program for Microsoft Windows. It includes its own raster graphics editor and file verification tool. It is published under GNU General Public License. The project is currently hosted by GitHub.</p>
        <p>ShareX is primarily targeted for power users, developers and testers. It is used to create full screen or partial screen captures. The captured screenshot can be annotated and edited using the built-in image editor or modifies using image effects before exporting it either to an image file, email attachment, printer, clipboard or remote host. If the image is uploaded to a remote host, the link generated by the remote host can be copied to clipboard.</p>
        <h2>Capturing</h2>
        <p>
            ShareX incorporates the following methods to allow screen capture:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fullscreen: Creates a screenshot of the entire screen area.</li>
            <li>Active window: Captures the currently active window.</li>
            <li>Active monitor: Captures the monitor area where the mouse cursor currently resides.</li>
            <li>Window menu: Has list of active windows so user can select which window to take screenshot of.</li>
            <li>Monitor menu: Has a list of monitors, so user can select which monitor to take screenshot from.</li>
            <li>Rectangle: Allows user to take screenshot from a single rectangle or multiple rectangular areas drawn by the mouse by dragging it from one corner of a rectangle to the diagonally opposite other corner of the rectangle.</li>
            <li>Rectangle / Window: Allows user to take screenshot of a rectangle area or when user hover window it will automatically select rectangular area of that window so user does not need to drag the area using the mouse.</li>
            <li>Rectangle (Light): Basic version of Rectangle capture designed for slow computers.</li>
            <li>Rounded Rectangle, Ellipse, Triangle, Diamond: Works similar to rectangle capture with the only difference being the shape.</li>
            <li>Polygon: Allows user to click points on screen to make polygon shape to capture areas inside it.</li>
            <li>Freehand: Allows user to draw areas similar to drawing with pencil and the inside area will be captured.</li>
            <li>Last Region: Will repeat the screen capture which was done last.</li>
            <li>Screen recording: User can record a selected area on user’s screen or the entire screen. Outputs are FFmpeg, Animated GIF and Video Compression Manager. FFmpeg allows user to record screen including sound and compress in real time using x264, VP8, Xvid etc.</li>
            <li>Auto capture: Allows user to automatically capture a screen area with specific time interval.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Post-capture tasks</h3>
        <p>
            User can select any or all of these tasks to be automatically run after each screen capture.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add image effects: User can choose from over 37 image effects and apply multiple image effects and apply them to an image.</li>
            <li>Add watermark: Adds customizable text/image watermark to image.</li>
            <li>Copy image to clipboard: Copies image to clipboard.</li>
            <li>Print image: Be able to print images with printer device.</li>
            <li>Save image to file: Saves image as file with user’s preferred image format.</li>
            <li>Save image to file as: Shows file dialog before saving so user can select where to write file to.</li>
            <li>Save thumbnail image to file: Saves resized image as file.</li>
            <li>Copy file to clipboard: Copies image file to clipboard.</li>
            <li>Copy file path to clipboard: Copies image file path to clipboard.</li>
            <li>Perform actions: User can automatically run other applications with image file path as the parameter so this way user can use Command-line interface applications to accomplish tasks which would have not been possible before. For example, user could open a screenshot in Paint.NET before uploading it to a remote host.</li>
            <li>Upload image to host: Allows user to automatically upload image file to a host that user selected. For example, user could upload images to Imgur, ImageShack, Flickr or upload as a file to Dropbox, Amazon S3 etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Uploading</h2>
        <p>
            ShareX has multiple ways to upload files.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clipboard upload: ShareX will automatically detect clipboard format and select tasks accordingly. It will first check if clipboard data format is an image, text or file. If the data format is text then it can check whether it is a URL or plaintext. If it is a URL then it can automatically shorten the URL or upload URL contents by downloading the file from the URL and uploading the content. It can also check whether it is a folder so it can index the contents of the folder. These settings are customizable through “Task settings” and are disabled by default due to privacy reasons.</li>
            <li>File upload: Uploads file to selected host according to file data type.</li>
            <li>Drag and drop upload (drop area or main window): User can drag and drop files to ShareX main window or to the drag & drop box in order to upload them.</li>
            <li>Shell context menu: In Windows user can right click file and select “Upload with ShareX” to upload that file.</li>
            <li>Send to (via rom Windows Explorer): Also when user right click file ShareX will be in “Send to” submenu.</li>
            <li>Watch folder: User can configure to watch specific folders so if new file appear in these folders that file will be automatically uploaded.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Post-upload tasks</h3>
        <p>
            These tasks will automatically run after successful upload to any host.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use URL shortener: Automatically shortens URL with selected URL shortener service.</li>

            <li>Show QR code window: URL will be shown as QR code in window. User can open URL in their mobile phone etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Secondary functions</h2>
        <p>
            Additional tools to make certain tasks more efficient:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Screen color picker: As the name suggests, allows user to retrieve the color from anywhere on the screen and provide values of Hue, Saturation, Brightness, and RGB.</li>

            <li>QR code: Open QR code window which user can enter text to get QR code of it. User can copy QR code image to user’s clipboard or save as file.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
            ShareX uses JSON data serialization to load and save settings. ShareX settings consist of three different configuration files. They are “Application settings”, “Hotkeys settings”, and “Uploaders settings”.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Application configuration file stores settings of the application’s interface settings and “Task settings” in the main window. These task settings which are accessible from the main window are somewhat common settings that can be overridden by each hotkey configuration. </li>
            <li>ShareX is workflow based. ShareX allows creation of multiple workflows which can be activated by keyboard hotkeys. Task settings can be specific to each hotkey. In other words, each hotkey can have different “Task settings”. These settings are saved in a hotkeys configuration file.</li>
            <li>Uploaders configuration file stores user authentication settings for all the third party image, text, and file hosting services.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Task settings</h3>
        <p>A task in ShareX is what is commonly understood as a workflow. For instance, a lifetime of a task can start from the moment user captures a screenshot via a keyboard shortcut or the menus in the main window, adding watermark, running external programs, uploading the screenshot, and retrieving a URL and saving it to the clipboard. Each task can be customized by the user can be assigned a hotkey. A list of hotkeys with task settings can be accessed via the “Hotkey settings” button in the main window.</p>
        <p>When the user accesses “Task settings” button in the main window, the user gets access to global task settings. For example, the user could open this task settings window and configure Watermark image path. When the user access task settings for each hotkey, user has the option to use these global task settings or override these global task settings. If the user chooses to follow global task settings, the screen recording task could use the Watermark image path configured in global task settings saving the user time reconfiguring the path. By default, task settings in each hotkey will follow global task settings.</p>
